This activity record is assembled from visible repository commits, pull requests, and GitHub Actions runs. Statuses reflect the latest checks observed when written; use the linked run for live status.

## Current snapshot
- Native Android app using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3.
- Target SDK Android 16 / API 36; minimum SDK 26.
- main includes merged PR #1.
- Phase 2 is in progress on `feature/phase-2-note-editor`, tracked by draft PR #2. **PR #2 is not merged.**
- Existing note persistence uses SharedPreferences / NoteStore; Phase 2 preserves its format.
- Emulator UI workflow is manual-only by project decision and is not a required CI gate.
- No physical-device testing is claimed.

## Pull requests
| PR | Title | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#1](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/1) | feat: Material 3 personalization and flexible note creation | **Merged** 2026-10-11 | Phase 1 dashboard modernization and personalization. |
| [#2](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/2) | feat: resilient inline note editor | **Open draft** | Early Phase 2 increment; further work and validation remain. |

## Work completed
### Foundation and delivery automation
- Created the native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose Android app.
- Added Android CI/CD and unit/instrumentation-test scaffolding.
- Fixed SDK setup and Compose UI-test dependency issues in CI.
- Added automated APK prereleases from main and corrected the release artifact path.
- Kept required CI focused on API 36; emulator UI workflow was made manually triggered after emulator reliability issues.

### Phase 1 — home screen (merged)
- Modernized the dashboard toward a calm, compact note-taking layout.
- Added compact/comfortable density preference and adaptive overview.
- Added note sort options and soft pastel / wallpaper-adaptive note colors.
- Improved category-chip styling, note-card color rendering in list layout, and create-note action.
- Added tests for dashboard/search/sorting, categories/empty state, note-color choices, settings/layout preferences, and related interactions.
- PR: [#1](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/1).

### Phase 2 — editor resilience (in progress)
Branch: `feature/phase-2-note-editor`; PR: [#2](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/2).
- Changed title, body, category, color, and reminder fields to Compose saveable state keyed to note ID.
- Added discard confirmation for explicit editor close and Cancel when meaningful unsaved changes exist.
- Added an instrumentation test for discard confirmation.
- Preserved NoteStore schema and local persistence format.
- Remaining: restore editor visibility/selection after activity recreation; route system/back and sheet dismissal through the same unsaved-change guard; review create/edit consistency and finish CI validation.

## Recent Phase 2 commits
| `be7da73` | Refined the launcher vector to include its own rounded-square deep-teal background, avoiding a full-bleed square when used as a legacy launcher drawable. The generated reference image was used as visual direction; vector remains a hand-built approximation, not a pixel-exact embedded PNG. | CI pending. |

| `9c1b6b2` | Added a custom NESTNOTE launcher vector drawable inspired by the generated icon concept (deep teal tile, layered pastel notes, folded golden corner, writing lines, N mark, pencil). | Pending CI. |
| `dada8ae` | Applied `@drawable/nestnote_launcher` as the Android application icon in the manifest. | Pending CI. |

| `ca8a723` | Fixed note-card foreground contrast: pastel cards now use stable dark primary text, secondary text, and icons rather than wallpaper-derived yellow/bright theme colors; adaptive cards still use Material 3 foreground colors. | CI pending; verify build before merge. |
| Commit | Change | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `e6db24a` | Save editor visibility and selected note ID across activity recreation; updated release workflow to use a rolling `latest` prerelease titled `NESTNOTE Latest Build` in the same branch commit `c47242e`. | Android CI failed at Kotlin compile on `MainActivity.kt:338` due to one remaining assignment to the now-derived `editorNote`; corrected in follow-up commit (see next row). |
| `124873a` | Fixed remaining note-card open handler to update `editorNoteId`. | CI failed due to conflicting/mistyped derived editor-note declaration; fixed in the following commit. |
| `def342a` | Corrected derived selected-note lookup to `notes.firstOrNull { it.id == editorNoteId }`. | CI re-run pending; current head is not yet validated. |

| `86469e6` | Added a parent-level unsaved-draft guard for system/back and sheet/dialog dismissal requests, while keeping editor Save/confirmed Cancel paths able to close directly. | CI pending; behavior needs automated validation. |

## Maintenance
Update this file when a PR merges, an implementation stage completes, or a material CI decision/status changes. Record factual outcomes only; distinguish planned, in-progress, and verified work.


## Phase 3 — Settings expansion

| Commit | Work | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `63fb556` | Added persistent preferences for default sort order, note preview visibility, and date/reminder visibility. | CI pending. |
| `360535f` | Added the Note behavior group to Settings with controls for sorting, previews, and timestamps/reminders. | CI pending. |
| `a2e9b0a` | Connected note-card rendering to the preview and timestamp preferences. | CI pending. |

## Validation policy

- Normal Android CI is required for each meaningful increment.
- Emulator UI workflow remains manual-only; visual verification must be recorded as manual when performed.
- Do not mark Phase 3 complete until preference persistence and existing note/editor flows are verified.
- Preserve the existing NoteStore format and user notes.

## Next steps

1. Run Android CI and fix any compile/test failures.
2. Add tests for preference persistence and preview/timestamp toggles.
3. Add default note category and starting category behavior.
4. Expand settings into Appearance, Layout, Note behavior, and Data & privacy groups without rewriting note storage.
