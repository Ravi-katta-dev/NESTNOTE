This activity record is assembled from visible repository commits, pull requests, and GitHub Actions runs. Statuses reflect the latest checks observed when written; use the linked run for live status.

## Current snapshot
- Native Android app using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3.
- Target SDK Android 16 / API 36; minimum SDK 26.
- main includes merged PR #1.
- Phase 2 is in progress on `feature/phase-2-note-editor`, tracked by draft PR #2. **PR #2 is not merged.**
- Existing note persistence uses SharedPreferences / NoteStore; Phase 2 preserves its format.
- Emulator UI workflow is manual-only by project decision and is not a required CI gate.
- No physical-device testing is claimed.

## Pull requests
| PR | Title | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#1](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/1) | feat: Material 3 personalization and flexible note creation | **Merged** 2026-10-11 | Phase 1 dashboard modernization and personalization. |
| [#2](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/2) | feat: resilient inline note editor | **Open draft** | Early Phase 2 increment; further work and validation remain. |

## Work completed
### Foundation and delivery automation
- Created the native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose Android app.
- Added Android CI/CD and unit/instrumentation-test scaffolding.
- Fixed SDK setup and Compose UI-test dependency issues in CI.
- Added automated APK prereleases from main and corrected the release artifact path.
- Kept required CI focused on API 36; emulator UI workflow was made manually triggered after emulator reliability issues.

### Phase 1 — home screen (merged)
- Modernized the dashboard toward a calm, compact note-taking layout.
- Added compact/comfortable density preference and adaptive overview.
- Added note sort options and soft pastel / wallpaper-adaptive note colors.
- Improved category-chip styling, note-card color rendering in list layout, and create-note action.
- Added tests for dashboard/search/sorting, categories/empty state, note-color choices, settings/layout preferences, and related interactions.
- PR: [#1](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/1).

### Phase 2 — editor resilience (in progress)
Branch: `feature/phase-2-note-editor`; PR: [#2](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/pull/2).
- Changed title, body, category, color, and reminder fields to Compose saveable state keyed to note ID.
- Added discard confirmation for explicit editor close and Cancel when meaningful unsaved changes exist.
- Added an instrumentation test for discard confirmation.
- Preserved NoteStore schema and local persistence format.
- Remaining: restore editor visibility/selection after activity recreation; route system/back and sheet dismissal through the same unsaved-change guard; review create/edit consistency and finish CI validation.
