# NESTNOTE — Native Android Notes

NESTNOTE is a local-first note-taking app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3.

- **Target SDK:** Android 16 / API 36
- **Minimum SDK:** API 26
- **Storage:** encrypted local note payloads using AES-GCM and Android Keystore
- **Sync:** no account or cloud sync

## Features
- Create, edit, pin, archive, restore, search, sort, and delete notes (with undo).
- Categories, pastel note colours, editor wallpapers, light/dark themes, and configurable dashboard layout.
- Full-screen and quick editors, checklist and bullet tools, list continuation, and optional writing statistics.
- Editor text-size options, reminder metadata, and copy/share actions.
- JSON backup and restore through Android's system file picker.
- Local-data recovery safeguards and validated, versioned backups.

## Install a release
Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/releases). Only download an APK attached to a versioned production release and verify its signature before installing. Historical “latest” or “CI-SIGNED” artifacts, if present, are not proof of production signing.

Production APKs are created from tags matching v*.*.* (for example, v1.2.0). The release workflow builds the minified release variant, signs it with the permanent production keystore supplied through GitHub Actions secrets, verifies the signature, and attaches the APK to the matching GitHub Release. A successful CI build alone does not establish release readiness.

### Production release steps
1. Confirm the candidate commit has passing Android CI and release checklist sign-off, including required device/recovery checks.
2. Confirm these repository Actions secrets exist without exposing their values: SIGNING_KEY (base64-encoded keystore), KEY_ALIAS, KEY_STORE_PASSWORD, and KEY_PASSWORD.
3. Create and push an approved version tag, e.g. git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0.
4. Wait for [Android Release](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/actions/workflows/android-release.yml) to finish.
5. Independently compare the APK certificate fingerprint with the recorded production certificate, install the exact published APK, and record the result before distribution.

A manually dispatched/non-tag release workflow run is for unsigned inspection output only; it must not be distributed as a production APK. Never commit keystores, passwords, signing keys, or other secret values.

## Data, backups, and recovery
Local notes are encrypted with AES-GCM using a key held by Android Keystore. Existing plaintext SharedPreferences records are migrated only after the encrypted payload is committed. If stored content cannot be read or decrypted, NESTNOTE preserves the original data and exposes a recovery path rather than silently replacing it with starter notes.

Backups exported by the user are **plaintext JSON** and should be stored securely. Restore validates the entire file before changing notes, supports the current versioned backup envelope and legacy JSON-array backups, merges by note ID, keeps the newer edited copy when timestamps differ, and does not delete notes absent from the backup. Automatic Android app-data backup is disabled.

Encryption protects data at rest; it is not a guarantee against a compromised device while the app is running. Losing/resetting the Android Keystore key may prevent decryption, so test and document recovery before release.

## Build and test
Open the repository in a recent stable Android Studio, allow Gradle sync, and install Android SDK Platform 36 if prompted.

With Java 17, Gradle 8.13, and Android SDK API 36 installed:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon testDebugUnitTest
gradle --no-daemon assembleDebug
gradle --no-daemon assembleRelease
gradle --no-daemon assembleDebugAndroidTest
```

The [Android CI workflow](https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/blob/main/.github/workflows/android-ci.yml) runs unit tests, builds debug and minified release APKs, compiles instrumentation tests, and executes Android instrumentation tests on an API 36 emulator. Do not claim physical-device, TalkBack, large-font, keyboard/insets, upgrade, migration, or visual-regression checks unless they were actually run and recorded.

## Current limitations
- Reminder dates/times are metadata only; alarm scheduling and notification delivery are not implemented.
- Checklist items can be toggled in the editor; rich-text formatting is not implemented.
- No account, remote sync, or server-side note storage is included.
- Android instrumentation tests run in CI on an API 36 emulator; physical-device and manual accessibility/visual checks remain separate release gates.


## Mandatory UI/UX direction
NESTNOTE follows [UI_UX_RULES.md](UI_UX_RULES.md). The immediate P0 is a polished note editor with an animated right-side Appearance panel (replacing the bottom appearance picker), shared by create/edit flows. App-wide consistency and accessibility auditing follow before backend/new-feature expansion. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for phases and [WORKLOG.md](WORKLOG.md) for evidence and implementation status.
