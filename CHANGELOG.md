# NESTNOTE Changelog

## v1.3.2 — Upcoming

### Fixed (Android CI)
- Show the inline voice-note seek slider for short recordings as well as long clips; previously, seeking was hidden for every clip shorter than 60 seconds.
- Run Android lint, unit tests, debug/release APK builds, and instrumentation-test compilation through the repository Gradle wrapper to keep the Gradle version consistent with the project.
- Remove hardcoded local Java 17 paths from `gradle.properties` so CI uses the Java installation configured on the runner.
- Hardened `SlimRailPanel` initial drag-anchor setup to avoid reading an uninitialized anchored-draggable offset during first layout.

### Testing and release readiness
- CI configuration fixes address Gradle provisioning and Java-home failures; confirm a complete green workflow run before release.
- Device-only gesture interruption, predictive-back cancellation, and editor integration checks remain pending.

## v1.3.1 — Current release

### Added
- Expanded the Markdown editor toolbar with H2/H3 headings, configurable heading levels, numbered lists, links, blockquotes, strikethrough, and inline code.
- Added Material 3 personalization and more flexible note creation.
- Added encrypted local voice-attachment storage, attachment metadata, and voice-note recording/playback integration.
- Added inline voice markers and preview-mode playback, with a single-player coordinator and insertion at the editor cursor.

### Improved
- Redesigned the app around a floating four-tab navigation bar with a central New action and a More hub for Library, Data, Preferences, Settings, Pinned, Archived, and Categories.
- Refreshed the visual system with Fraunces display typography, warm light/dark palettes, an optional AMOLED-black theme, and shared expressive motion.
- Reworked the editor with a slim right-side tool rail, compact Markdown controls, borderless writing fields, keyboard-docked formatting actions, lock/edit modes, and on-demand voice controls.
- Improved adaptive layouts, predictive-back navigation, and editor sizing for expanded windows.
- Hardened voice-attachment lifecycle handling, including safe cleanup after deletion is committed and orphan-attachment reconciliation.
- Updated F-Droid listing/metadata documentation to reflect current app features and added checks for repository publication.

### Fixed
- Fixed the `SlimRailPanel` initial anchored-drag offset crash and added Compose regression coverage.
- Corrected Markdown numbered-list matching, link insertion cursor placement, and Markdown preview link navigation.
- Added Markdown preview HTML-safety tests and expanded editor formatting regression coverage.

### Notes
- Voice attachments are stored locally and remain excluded from the current JSON backup/restore format.
- The self-hosted F-Droid repository is separate from the official F-Droid listing; successful workflow completion should be followed by checking the published repository index.
- This entry summarizes feature and fix commits found in the repository history. The exact v1.3.1 release date and precise commit/tag boundary were not independently confirmed.

## v1.2.8 — Historical entry

### Changed (UI/UX redesign, branch `feature/ui-redesign`)
- Split `MainActivity.kt` into theme, preferences, app shell, settings, note card, editor and appearance files (no behaviour change).
- New warm light/dark palettes, Fraunces display font (SIL OFL, see `docs/THIRD_PARTY_FONTS.md`) and shared motion tokens; fixed the typography definition dropping default font sizes.
- Floating four-tab bar (Home, Notes, New, Reminders, More); the More tab now hosts Pinned, Archived, Categories, Backup & restore and Settings.
- Editor: slim vertical tool rail (Colour, Background, Format) replaces the two wide side panels; pin, reminder, voice note, read mode, archive, share, copy and delete moved into the editor More menu; single category chip; voice recorder revealed on demand.
- Optional pure-black dark mode.

### Fixed
- Hardened `SlimRailPanel` initial drag-anchor setup to avoid reading an uninitialized anchored-draggable offset during first layout.
- Updated Android CI to run all build and test tasks through the repository's Gradle wrapper, keeping the Gradle version consistent with the project configuration.
- Removed hardcoded local Java 17 paths from `gradle.properties` so CI uses the Java installation configured by the runner.

### Testing
- Added Compose instrumentation regression coverage for initial closed rendering, repeated open/close transitions, and custom panel/rail widths.
- Android CI fixes address Gradle provisioning and Java-home configuration failures. A successful full CI run after these fixes still needs confirmation; device-only gesture interruption, predictive-back cancellation, and editor integration checks remain pending.

## v1.2.7

### Added
- Redesigned note-editor appearance and formatting access with a slim rail and more discoverable controls.
- Expanded note appearance customization and integrated Markdown formatting tools, including headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code, links, lists, checklists, and blockquotes.
- Release-to-F-Droid workflow orchestration so the self-hosted F-Droid publishing workflow can run after the GitHub release workflow completes successfully.

### Improved
- Refined the editor layout and interaction patterns using stable Material 3 components and API 36-compatible implementation choices.
- Improved access to formatting and appearance controls while keeping the writing area focused.
- Clarified release automation sequencing to reduce the chance of publishing F-Droid metadata before a successful release build.

### Distribution notes
- The self-hosted F-Droid repository remains separate from the official F-Droid listing.
- Automated workflow completion does not by itself prove that the repository index is available; verify the published index after a successful publishing run.

## v1.2.6

### Added
- Inline voice recording and audio-file attachment actions inside the Note editor.
- A recording review step after stopping, with preview playback, rename, explicit Attach, and Discard actions.
- Inline audio attachment cards with play/pause, seek/progress, elapsed time, and total duration.
- Support for multiple audio attachments in one note, with independent controls for each card.

### Improved
- Kept audio recording and playback within the Note tab, without playback dialogs, a separate audio tab, a mini-tab, or a floating mini-player.
- Improved recording-state feedback, elapsed-time display, and the review-before-attach workflow.
- Preserved existing note content and attachments when reviewing or discarding an additional recording.
- Continued hardening audio attachment lifecycle and playback regression coverage.

### Compatibility and privacy notes
- Audio-file import currently supports uncompressed 16-bit mono or stereo WAV files; other formats are not yet supported.
- Voice recordings are stored as local attachments. Audio attachments remain excluded from the current JSON backup/restore format.
- NESTNOTE remains local-first with no account-based cloud sync.

## v1.2.5 — 2026-10-18

### Added
- Voice-note recording and playback support, including audio attachment metadata and encrypted local attachment storage.
- Voice attachment lifecycle cleanup, including cleanup after note deletion and the undo window.
- Contextual Markdown heading control in the editor.
- NESTNOTE branding assets for web and F-Droid repository presentation.

### Improved
- Hardened local note encryption with authenticated v2 storage.
- Improved saved voice-recording playback handling and regression coverage.
- Strengthened recording recovery and lifecycle behavior.
- Expanded editor, storage, backup, release, and F-Droid distribution documentation.

### Privacy and backup notes
- Voice recordings are stored as local attachments; audio attachments are intentionally excluded from the current JSON backup/restore format.
- User-exported JSON backups contain plaintext note data and should be stored securely.
- NESTNOTE remains local-first with no account-based cloud sync.

### Distribution
- GitHub Release APK: https://github.com/Ravi-katta-dev/NESTNOTE/releases/tag/v1.2.5
- Self-hosted F-Droid repository publication is managed separately and should be considered available only after its publishing workflow succeeds and the repository index is verified.
- This self-hosted repository is not an official F-Droid listing.

### Changes included
- CI and signed Android release workflow improvements
- F-Droid repository automation and branding
- Authenticated v2 note storage and voice attachment foundation/lifecycle
- Voice recording/playback regression fixes and recovery documentation
- Editor and backup/release audit updates
